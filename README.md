Here’s a **README.md** for your fun calculator project:

---

# 🎉 Fun Calculator in Python! 🎉

This is a simple yet fun Python program that acts as a **mini-calculator**. It allows users to **add**, **subtract**, **multiply**, and **divide** two numbers like a boss! 😎

---

## ✨ Features

* ➕ **Addition** of two numbers
* ➖ **Subtraction** (first number minus second)
* ✖️ **Multiplication**
* ➗ **Division** (with an assumption that the second number isn’t zero)

---

## 🛠 How It Works

1. The program **asks the user** to input two numbers.
2. It performs **four mathematical operations**:

   * Sum
   * Difference
   * Product
   * Quotient
3. Displays the **results** in a clear and friendly format.

---

## 📋 Requirements

* Python **3.x** installed on your machine.

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone or download this project.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project folder.
3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   python fun_calculator.py
   ```
4. Enter two numbers when prompted and enjoy the results! 🎉

---

## ✅ Example Output

```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5

Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 15.0
Difference: 5.0
Product: 50.0
Quotient: 2.0
```

---

## ⚠️ Note

* The program **does not handle division by zero**. Be kind and avoid entering `0` as the second number. 😉

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Handle division by zero with an error message.
* Add more operations (modulus, exponentiation).
* Create a GUI version using Tkinter for extra fun! 🎨
